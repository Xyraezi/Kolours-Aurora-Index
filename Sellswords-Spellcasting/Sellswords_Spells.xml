			<p>You invoke both death and life upon a 10-foot-radius sphere centred on a point within range. Each creature of your choice in that area must make a CON save, taking 2d6 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Nonmagical vegetation in that area withers.</p>
			<p>In addition, any creature of your choosing in that area can spend and roll one of its unspent Hit Dice and gain a number of temporary hit points equal to double of the roll plus your spellcasting ability modifier.</p>
			<p>At higher levels, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot above the 2nd, and the number of Hit Dice that can be spent and added to the healing roll increases by one for each slot above 2nd.</p>

			<p><i>This is a rare spell available only to BRD, SOR, WAR and WIZ after being found in the world, or taught by someone who knows it.</i></p>
			<p>You prepare to steal the magical prowess of your foes. As part of the action to cast this spell, and as an action on each turn for the duration of this spell, you can attempt a sleight of hand (DEX) check against an opponent. The DC of this check depends on the level of the spell being stolen, being 12 + the level of the spell.</p>
			<p>On a success, you gain a temporary spell slot with which you can cast the stolen spell, and the target takes 1d4 psychic damage per level of the spell.</p>
			<p>You retain, and the target loses, knowledge of this spell for the remainder of the one minute, but you no longer need to concentrate on this spell. While a spell is stolen, you cannot make further attempts to steal spells.</p>
			<p>The spell being stolen is determined at random among spells of the level of the slot used to cast this spell; If there are no spells of that level, the next-lower level of spells is subject. If the target knows no spells, this spell fails but you remain able to attempt to steal spells.</p>
			<p>At higher levels, you can steal spells of higher spell slots. You also gain a +1 bonus to the sleight of hand (DEX) check for each level of the slot used to cast this spell, over the spell being stolen.</p>

			<p>You draw forth the ebbing life force of a creature and use it to fuel your own power. Upon casting this spell, you touch a living creature that has died within 1 round or is at 0 hit points. If the subject has not died, it rolls a WIS save against your spell DC. If it fails, it automatically fails a death saving throw.</p>
			<p>Regardless, you gain 1d8 temporary hit points and a +2 bonus to Strength. Additionally, your spell attack rolls and saving throw modifiers have a +1 bonus. These effects last for 10 minute per HD of the subject creature.</p>

			<p><i>This is a rare spell available only to WIZ after being found in the world, or taught by someone who knows it.</i></p>
			<p>This spell creates a circular, horizontal plane of force, 3 feet in diameter and 1 inch thick, that floats 3 feet above the ground underneath yourself, with you atop. The disk remains for the duration, and can hold up to 500 pounds. If more weight is placed on it, the spell ends, and everything on the disk falls to the ground.</p>
			<p class="indent">The disk can move up to 10ft. every round. It can more across uneven terrain, up or down stairs, slopes and the like, but it canâ€™t cross an elevation change of 10 feet or more. For example, the disk canâ€™t move across a 10-foot-deep pit, nor could it leave such a pit if it was created at the bottom.</p>
			<p class="indent">If it would ever be farther than 10ft away from you, the spell ends.</p>
