			<p>When you cast a spell, you can spend 2 sorcery point to cause targets of an alignment of your choice to be outlined in light. If they didn’t already make a saving throw against the spell, they must make a Charisma saving throw or become outlined in light until the end of your next turn. This light can be a colour of your choice. (Usually, green is for good, red is for evil, orange is for lawful, purple is for chaotic, and white is for neutrals.)</p>
			<p>The attack roll against an affected creature or object has advantage if the attacker can see it, and the affected creature or object can't benefit from being invisible. If any are successful, they immediately stop glowing.</p>

		<description>
			<p>WWhen you cast a spell that affects one or more points or directions (such as bonfire, burning hands, and sword burst), you can spend 1 sorcery point to delay its effect up to a number of rounds equal to your proficiency bonus. It becomes a magical mote at the origin (for lines and cones) or center (for circles and squares). The space must be unoccupied. It can then be activated as an action on your turn (or as a reaction, if the action was readied) for the spell to be cast from the mote’s location. Any decisions needed for the spell is made when it was cast. For example, using mold earth to create difficult terrain in a certain spot. </p>
			<p>You can have multiple delayed spells active, but you may only activate one at a time. You do not need to concentrate on these spells until they activate. If a creature were to touch a mote, they must make a Dexterity saving throw to back away or avoid contact. On a failed save, the spell activates. They can be dispelled, and counterspell requires vision on the mote, not yourself. If a spell creates multiple motes, they activate together simultaneously.</p>
			<p class="indent"> You can use Delayed Spell even if you have already used a different Metamagic option during the casting of the spell..</p>
