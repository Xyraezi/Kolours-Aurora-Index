		<description>
			<p>Yuan-ti were originally humans who transformed themselves into serpent folk through ancient rituals. Most yuan-ti were corrupted into monsters by those rites, but some yuan-ti instead became a new people who mix characteristics of humans and snakes.</p>
			<h4>YUAN-TI TRAITS</h4>
			<p>All nagas share the following traits.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Ability Score Increase. </i></b>Your Constitution score increases by 2, and your Intelligence score increases by 1.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Alignment. </i></b>Most naga are either neutral or neutral evil in alignment.</p>

	<!--Ratfolk Race (by Dirt)-->
	<element name="Ratfolk" type="Race" source="Sellsword's Stuff: Ancestries" id="ID_SELLSWORDS_RACES_RATFOLK">
		<description>
			<p>To the people at large, ratfolk find the most difficulty with life in Korrik. They are deft of foot and are sometimes drawn to a criminal lifestyle. Though this is true of some ratfolk, they are no more violent or larcenous than others, but old stereotypes linger, especially with them. Called the nenajaa, or “we who live” in Rat Speech, many fail to understand the tough lives ratfolk lead are not entirely of their making.</p>
			
			<h4>Wiry and Lanky</h4>
			<p>Ratfolks are a rodent-like humanoids. They are shorter than humans, and appear almost frail. They have heads shaped like rats, with an elongated skull, thin lips, a rat's snout, and monocoloured beads for eyes. The fur that grows on their bodies is usually thin, and commonly comes in a range from light browns to dark gray and black. Despite their origins in the Feywild, they are not themselves fey.</p>
			
			<h4>Life in the Shadow</h4>
			<p>Due to their association with rats, they are generally avoided by the aristocracies of human settlements, but can find places amongst the elves and dwarves for example. They are usually a nocturnal folk but, contrary to popular beliefs, are not sensitive to light.</p>
			
			<h4>A Place in the World</h4>
			<p>Although not a people with great history, only having made a presence after the Era of Upheavals, there are a decent number of ratfolk communities. They tend to stay with each other in great families, both for cultural reasons, and the societal one that they have poor reputations. Many ratfolk families end up in the protective of Cormyr, but just as many work with the seedy underbellies of cities such as Westgate and Neverwinter.</p>
			<h4>RATFOLK TRAITS</h4>
			<p>The ratfolk character is a race that focuses on several traits, holding these to be common ground among the vast majority of their race.</p>
			<p>Quick and silent, ratfolk exist as outsiders no matter where they are, but they let nothing get in their way.</p>
			
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Ability Score Increase.</em></strong> Your Dexterity score increases by 2, and your Intelligence score increases by 1.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Creature Type.</em></strong> You are a Humanoid.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Size.</em></strong> Ratfolk look thin and frail, standing about 5'3” and 5'6”, and weighing around 110–120 lbs. Your size is Medium.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Speed.</em></strong> Your base walking speed is 35 feet. Ratfolk are quick on their feet.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Alignment.</em></strong> Ratfolk are strongly inclined to follow their own path, preferring freedom over all else, which makes them strongly chaotic. Ratfolk are rarely evil, but most are morally neutral.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Age.</em></strong> Ratfolk commonly live a due to quick reproduction and harsh environment and social practices little over 50 years, maintaining good vitality and longevity toward the end. Ratfolk reach adulthood at age 15, with the fur on their bodies turning grey once they've lived about 30 years.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Darkvision.</em></strong> You are used to dark areas, and your eyes have adjusted to such. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of grey.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Sneaky.</em></strong> You have proficiency in the Stealth skill.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Thin Frame.</em></strong> You can squeeze through spaces as if you were one size smaller.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Languages.</em></strong> You can speak, read, and write Common and Sylvan.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Subrace.</em></strong> Ratfolk are a varied lot, and tend to adapt to their environment. Choose a subrace from between urban and wild.</p>
